  GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "大戦の後に"
  GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "第一次や第二次を大きく上回る犠牲者を出した大戦は終わり、今度こそは安定した時代が来ると思われた。しかし、この世界にはまだよからぬことを考えている人たちがいる。核の冬を到来させようと目論む者や、それに協力しようとする者。先の大戦の復讐を考える者や、世界帝国を作ろうとする者もいる。この世界では何が起こるかは全く分からない、、、。"
  HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
  HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
  ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
  FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
  PRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
  ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
  JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
  SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
  USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
  OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
  POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
  RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
  HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
  ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
  PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
  POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Salazar's rise to power in 1932, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the First Republic. Fiscal Autonomy and Political Independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army. \n\nNow, Portugal must decide the way forward as political and social instability increases in neighboring Spain and international tensions are hopelessly worsening..."
  BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Liberation War of 1878 and the rejection of the San Stefano Treaty by Western democracies, Bulgaria has lived through a long history of conflict and betrayal in the Balkans. As a defeated member of the Central Powers in the Great War, Bulgaria suffered heavy territorial losses and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine imposed harsh economic sanctions and severe military restrictions. \n\nBut with the major political and social changes taking place in Europe, it is time for Bulgaria to choose its own path and find its rightful place in the Balkans."
  TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey was born. Turkish independence was won with blood and bullets in the National Campaign of 1923, and while the struggle was righteous the cost continues to weigh heavily upon the Turkish people. \n\nReligious conservatives plague the hinterlands and resist nation-wide modernization efforts in the strongest terms, while Kurdish nationalists wreak havoc in the east of the country. Lionized president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk must unite the country or pass the torch to a leader who can, and they must do it soon as trouble stirs in Europe..."
